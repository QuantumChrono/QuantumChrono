# Swayam Mohapatra

CS Undergrad. I sit somewhere between visual arts and systems engineering.

I'm not into the rat race or competitive programming. I just like building things that look good and work well. I use AI to handle the boring parts so I can focus on the design and the big picture.

### What I do
I'm exploring **Generative AI** and **Product Engineering**.

**The Stack:**
*   **Core:** Python, TypeScript
*   **Web:** Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase
*   **AI:** PyTorch, Groq/Llama

### Current Project
**[Unicorpse](https://your-vercel-link.app)**
An AI tool that ruthlessly roasts startup ideas using Peter Thiel’s *Zero to One* framework.
*   *The Irony:* Yes, it is technically a wrapper. I built a wrapper to roast people for building wrappers.
*   *Tech:* Next.js, Groq API, and a gamified loading state because spinners are boring.

### Interests
*   **Systems:** How things scale (and how they break).
*   **Art:** Visuals, aesthetics, and UI.
*   **Gaming:** Analyzing mechanics (and collecting virtual coins).
*   **Music:** I play the piano and I'm currently picking up the guitar.
